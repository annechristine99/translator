1. Pulling the template from github

2. Linking the API with the key correctly

3. Creating a button that when it clicks, it will respond to the form. 

4. English being displayed on the form when the user types it. 

5. When the English is written on the form, the user clicks on the button
and the words are appended to the DOM. 

6. The words should turn into Dothraki, therefore, the url for the API replaces the English
when words are appended to the DOM. 

7. The AJAX calls onto the data from the API for the English words and the Dothraki words
and within a function, the words are written on the form, then when the words are appended on 
the DOM, the words are in Dothraki.

8. When the user clicks on the button, the Dothraki words are cleared from the DOM and the
user can write in another word or phrase that can be translated into Dothraki. 

9. Some words do not exist in the Dothraki language and the words are inspired from GoT show and 
books as reference. Example: The Dothraki language has no future tense. The word "will" 
does not translate in a sentence or phrase. 

Problems: 
1. Understanding how the API works based on the documentation and then realizing that the full
documentation was not necessary to get the data from the API. The wording was complicated
when the API itself is not. 

2. Saving infomation from the API so the user can have control on what they want to save 
from the results when they use the translator. 

3. To make the app even more user-friendly, a new API should be built for Dothraki words
to be translated back into English.
